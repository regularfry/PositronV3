# Building A Positron

This site is a guide to building Kralyn's Positron V3, incorporating as
much community feedback and learning as we can manage.

This site is *not* the place to look or contribute to if you want
improvements on the basic v3 design, unless Kralyn (or another member of
the Positron team) can incorporate them into the upstream.  Other people
are doing a good job of figuring out useful modifications elsewhere.

These docs are for building the V3 as designed only.  By keeping the
scope constrained, we reduce the amount of work we need to do to keep it
maintained.
