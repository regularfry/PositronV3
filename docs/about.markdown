This site came about as a result of two observations:

1. Kralyn is extremely busy and hasn't had the time to finish
   documenting how to build a Positron yet
2. People are repeatedly running into the same problems with the current
   published material, and it seems to make sense to improve the docs
   available to the community to make sure those lessons need to be
   learned as few times as possible.
3. Some of the problems people have are a result of the existing
   information not being easy to find.

So... let's fix that.
